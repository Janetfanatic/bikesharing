# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Background
Citibike is an exciting bicycle sharing program found in New York City. According to the Citibikes website it is the largest program if its kind in the United States with 950 stations.  This program offers day passes and memberships. Citibike promotes day passes for tourists and memberships for city residients. Users are able to pay to unlock bikes at a station and take 30 - 45 mintues rides around the city.  At the conclusion of their excursion, users return and lock their bike at any citibike station around the city. (CitiBike, 2020)
## Data Retrieval
For this chanllege we were tasked with answering one of three questions. The question choosen: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

To answer these questions information was gathered from the Citibikes website, U.S Census Bureau, Catch Des Monines (visitors Bureau and Sports Commission) and supplemental data provided with this project.

## Information
### Population and Income
Compared to New York City the City of Des Moines s significantly lower.  New York City's population stands at 8,336,817 (US Census, 2019) and the population of Des Moines is estimated to 214,237. (US Census Bureau, 2019)  According to the 2018 census map, the income distribution is homogenous in Des Moines with an average income of $52,251.  In constrast the income map for New York City shows great diversity but ironicly the average income is only slightly higher than Des Moines at $60,762. (US Census Bureau, 2019)
### Customers
CitiBike offers two options, a day pass or a membership subscription. According to data provided for this project, the majority of Cititbike uses are subscribers.  Citibike promotes memberships as an option for New York City residients. Des Moines also has a bike sharing program located in one of its many parks called BCycle. In comparison it is significantly smaller with only 20 stations compare to CitiBikes 950 stations that are spread across the city.  The Catch Des Moines lists at least eight trails that are ideal for bike riding (Catch Des Moines, 2020), could Citibike increase access and visitors to these city attractions?
### Utilization and Location
In August 2018, there were 2,344,224 recorded City bike uses.  Of these recorded rides, males’ users out numbered female users. According to Catch Des Moines (2020), Central Iowa has 600 miles of paved trails that are bike ready.   Along these trails’ users can find restrooms, water fountains, parking, bike shops, picnic areas, and picturques locations along lakes. Des Monis also offers bike trail on their city street increase their available trails to 800 miles.  Take a quick look at how extensive Citibike use and locations are in NYC, the possibilites are endless in Des Moines.
### Summer Fun
With the extra hours of day light there is more time to have fun.  In August 2018 (CitiBike, 2020), ridership saw an up tick at 6 am and peaked at 5 pm. This would be a wonderful addition to the many summer activies found in Des Moines. Catch Des Moines (2020) highlights the many activies available including, pontoon rides on lake Saylorville, shooping at Jordan Creek Mall, the Greater Des Moines farmers market hand made goods, Adventureland (Iowa's largest theme park) and many more.  There are activites to keep residents and visitors entertained all day long.
## Conclusion
Citibike would be a great addition to Des Moines current bike sharing program.  There are so many places to go in Des Moines and many trails to cover, Des Monies was made for bicycle lovers.
